VGA driver task
---------------

The current driver is a couple of lib functions we added, which are able to
paint/put pixels with the required colors.
We must move that VGA code into the proper place (vga driver, using open,
read, write, close.. primitives).
On runtime one process will control the display (probably the window manager/
isual interface, so far, microui).

One option of abstract operations for the vga driver might be:

microui draft code:

open(VGA);
seek(VGA, 2048);       /* if the screen is 1024x768, 2048 position might be the
			  first pixel on 3rd line */
write(VGA, buf, 128);   /* the buf buffer contains the colors of the next  
                         * pixels to paint on screen, starting at 2048 pixel.
			 * As we are using 32bpp we would paint the next 32
			 * pixels. 
                         */

/* when microui finishes */
close(VGA);
